      <h1>Frisbee History!</h1>
      <p>
        Ultimate frisbee (officially simply called ultimate) is a non-contact
        team sport played with a disc flung by hand. Ultimate was developed in
        1968 by Joel Silver, Buzzy Hellring, and Jonny Hines in Maplewood, New
        Jersey.[5][6] Although ultimate resembles many traditional sports in its
        athletic requirements, it is unlike most sports due to its focus on
        self-officiating, even at the highest levels of competition.[7] The term
        "frisbee" is a registered trademark of the Wham-O toy company, and thus
        the sport is not formally called "ultimate frisbee", though this name is
        still in common casual use (and the trademark was licensed to the
        Ultimate Frisbee Association in 2024).[8] Points are scored by passing
        the disc to a teammate in the opposing end zone. <br />

        Other basic rules are that players must not take steps while holding the
        disc, while interceptions, incomplete passes, and passes out of bounds
        are turnovers (change in possession). Rain, wind, or occasionally other
        adversities can make for a testing match with rapid turnovers,
        heightening the pressure of play. From its beginnings in the American
        counterculture of the late 1960s, ultimate has resisted empowering any
        referee with rule enforcement. Instead, it relies on the sportsmanship
        of players and invokes the "spirit of the game" to maintain fair
        play.[9] Players call their own fouls, and dispute a foul only when they
        genuinely believe it did not occur. Playing without referees is the norm
        for league play but has been supplanted in club competition by the use
        of "observers" or "game advisors" to help in disputes, and the
        professional league employs empowered referees.
