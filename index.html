        <li> <bold>Ultimate Frisbee </bold>(officially simply called ultimate) is a non-contact team sport played with a disc flung by hand.</li>
        <li> unlike most sports due to its focus on self-officiating, even at the highest levels of competition.</li>
        <li> The term "frisbee" is a registered trademark of the Wham-O toy company, and thus the sport is not formally called "ultimate frisbee"</li>
        <li> was licensed to the Ultimate Frisbee Association in 2024</li>

      <h2> Rules</h2>
      <div class="box-content size-32 border-4 p-4">
      <ul>
        <li>game has seven players per team. In mixed ultimate, the teams usually play with a "4-3" ratio, meaning either 4 men and 3 women or 4 women and 3 men will be playing. <br></li>
        <li>The first European Championship tournament for national teams was held in 1980 in Paris. Finland won, with England and Sweden finishing second and third. <code> <br></li>

      <h3>Technical Rules</h3>
      <div class="box-content size-32 border-4 p-4">
      <ul>
        <li> Each point begins with the two teams starting in opposite end zones</li>
        <li> To score goals, the players of each team try to get the possession of the flying disc (without making physical contact with players), pass it from one teammate to the other, and keep it away from the opponents till it is carried all the way towards their (opponentsâ€™) end zone or goal area</li>
        <li> Ultimate is non-contact. Non-incidental, play-affecting, or dangerous physical contact is not allowed.</li>
        <li> The defensive "marker" counts aloud to 10 seconds, which is referred to as "stalling". If the disc has not been thrown when the defending player reaches 10, it is turned over to the other team.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2> Strategies and Tactics</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Most basic strategies are an attempt to create open space (e.g. lanes) on the field in which the thrower and receiver can complete a pass.</li>
        <li> Designated throwers are called handlers and designated receivers are called cutters.</li>
        <li> One of the most common offensive strategies is the vertical stack. In this strategy, a number of offensive players line up between the disc and the end zone they are attacking.</li>
      </ol>
