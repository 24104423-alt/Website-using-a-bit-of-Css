        <li><b>Ultimate Frisbee</b> (officially simply called ultimate) is a non-contact team sport played with a disc flung by hand.</li>
        <li>Unlike most sports due to its focus on self-officiating, even at the highest levels of competition.</li>
        <li>The term "frisbee" is a registered trademark of the Wham-O toy company, and thus the sport is not formally called "ultimate frisbee".</li>
        <li>Was licensed to the Ultimate Frisbee Association in 2024.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Rules</h2>
      <div class="box-content size-32 border-4 p-4">
        <ul>
          <li>Game has seven players per team. In mixed ultimate, the teams usually play with a "4-3" ratio, meaning either 4 men and 3 women or 4 women and 3 men will be playing.</li>
          <li>The first European Championship tournament for national teams was held in 1980 in Paris. Finland won, with England and Sweden finishing second and third.</li>
          <li>In 1981, the European Flying Disc Federation (EFDF) was formed. Each point begins with both teams lining up on the front of their respective end zone line.</li>
        </ul>

      <h3>Technical Rules</h3>
      <div class="box-content size-32 border-4 p-4">
        <ul>
          <li>Each point begins with the two teams starting in opposite end zones.</li>
          <li>To score goals, the players of each team try to get the possession of the flying disc, pass it from one teammate to the other, and carry it towards the opponentsâ€™ end zone.</li>
          <li>Ultimate is non-contact. Non-incidental, play-affecting, or dangerous physical contact is not allowed.</li>
          <li>The defensive "marker" counts aloud to 10 seconds, called "stalling". If the disc has not been thrown by then, it is turned over to the other team.</li>
        </ul>

      <h2>Strategies and Tactics</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Most basic strategies attempt to create open space (lanes) on the field where a thrower and receiver can complete a pass.</li>
        <li>Designated throwers are called handlers and designated receivers are called cutters.</li>
        <li>One common offensive strategy is the vertical stack, where offensive players line up between the disc and the end zone they are attacking.</li>
      </ol>
