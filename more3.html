      <p>
        Vertical Stack
               <li> This offense was first created in response to the idea of "setting a force." "The force" is when the person marking the disc attempts to force the thrower to throw to a particular side of the field.  

                The purpose of a vertical stack is to create two passing lanes - one on the "open" side of the field and one on the "break" side of the field. The "open" and "break" side of the field are defined by the force.

                <li>However, if teams become to rigid about these guidelines, the offense will be too predictable and easy to counter.

                A vertical stack can use either two or three handlers. Many teams like to have one handler in the reset space to help out if there are no open cuts downfield. Some teams have the second handler at the front of the stack instead looking for quick options to the break side or o come into the reset space if necessary. Some teams will have other options - one handler in the reset space and the other in the front of the stack.

                Advantages and Disadvantages of the Vertical Stack
                </li>The vertical stack can create a lot of space for cutters to work with. It can be a good strategy when your team has a few dominant cutters.
                <br><br>
                <li>The vertical stack can be used the whole way into the endzone (unlike some other formations) with no change in tactics during the point.

                Some disadvantages of the vertical stack are that it can be easy to counter with a clam defense or poaches in the lane. If your opponent decides to play zone defense, you will need to change your offensive formation immediately during the point.

                </li>If you are using a vertical stack, you will want to have some handlers who can break the mark effectively or who can work together to get the disc to the break side by dumping and swinging the disc effectively. You will want cutters who can athletically match-up against their defenders and get open.

      <h1>Zone Offense</h1>
      <p>
        Zone Offense
This type of offense is done in response to a zone defense.

The goal in a zone offense is to get beyond the first line of defense. There are basically three ways to do this.

Swinging the disc horizontally among the handler to get around the front wall or cup
Get the disc through the cup by breaking the mark of the cup or getting it to a popper
Going overtop with a hammer, a huck, or a blade.<br><br> Often the defense is trying to force these types of throws, especially in a high wind situation so proceed with caution!
